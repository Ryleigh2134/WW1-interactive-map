                    <h2>About World War 1</h2>
                    <p>World War I, also known as the Great War was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Entente and the Central Powers. The war started in 28 July 1914 due to Serbia denying Austrian demands after a Serb killed the Austrian hier. Fighting lasted 11 November 1918 after Germany and all other Central Power nations surrendered. </p>

                    <h2>The aftermath</h2>
                    <p>By the time the Paris Peace Conference ended which was the formal end of the war the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian empires had already been shattered. With this peace many nations found themselves upset or unsatisfied leading to the rise of extremist ideologies and the eventual Second World War.</p>

                    <h2>About my site</h2>
                    <p>I have chosen to make this site because I have always found the First World War interesting but have also found that few people even knew what the map looked like at the time. Due to my interest in maps and the First World War as well as not being able to find a good site informing the user of every nation at the time I have tried to make a good informative site with an accurate map and base level information for every european nation</p>
